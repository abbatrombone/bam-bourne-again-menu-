Concept 

This is a template on how to build menus into the terminal for linux. These are all useable templates on their own but are made to be examples of what these could look like. For who this works use the documentation.md file. This explains how everything works as if you were new to bash. This project is built on having 0 (zero) dependacies and using just bash to run the script.

Future Features I hope to inculde
* check boxes
* radio buttons
