Concept 

This is a template on how to build menus into the terminal for linux. These are all useable templates on their own but are made to be examples of what these could look like. For who this works use the documentation.md file. This explains how everything works as if you were new to bash. This project is built on having 0 (zero) dependacies and using just bash to run the script. If you have features you wish to be added please create an issue. If you have good menus you like to add please create an issue with the code so it can be reviewed and added.
